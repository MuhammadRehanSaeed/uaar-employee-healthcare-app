    content:
    "Walking daily can reduce your risk of catching a cold or the flu. Studies have shown that people who walk at least 20 minutes a day, 5 days a week, have 43% fewer sick days. And if you get sick, you’re likely to have milder symptoms. When you walk, your heart rate goes up, and this lowers your blood pressure. It improves your heart health over time and helps your overall circulation. You can also reduce your risk of stroke by walking 2 miles a day. Going on morning walks can help you tone your leg and abdominal muscles. Stronger muscles give you a wider range of motion and improve your overall strength and health. The pressure of moving is also shifted from your joints to your muscles. ",

    "Drinking enough water daily is essential for temperature regulation, digestion, and overall energy. Your body depends on water to survive. Every cell, tissue, and organ in your body needs water to work properly. For example, your body uses water to maintain its temperature, remove waste, and lubricate your joints. Good hydration is important for overall good health. Most people have been told they should drink 6 to 8, 8-ounce glasses of water each day. That’s a reasonable goal. However, different people need different amounts of water to stay hydrated. Most healthy people can stay well hydrated by drinking water and other fluids whenever they feel thirsty. For some people, fewer than 8 glasses may be enough. Other people may need more.While plain water is best for staying hydrated, other drinks and foods can help, too. Water can be found in fruits and vegetables (for example, watermelon, tomatoes, and lettuce), and in soup broths. Fruit and vegetable juices, milk, and herbal teas add to the amount of water you get each day. Just make sure to limit sugary drinks that are high in calories.",
